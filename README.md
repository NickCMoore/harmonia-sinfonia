## Design & Planning

### Problem Statement

Orchestra members often face significant challenges in staying connected and informed outside of rehearsals and performances. Traditional methods of communication, such as email or sporadic meetings, can be inefficient and fail to create a cohesive sense of community. Additionally, there is no centralised platform for members to share content, discuss music, or coordinate events effectively. These issues can lead to missed opportunities for collaboration, a lack of engagement, and difficulty in organising events and rehearsals efficiently.

### Target Audience

Harmonia Sinfonia is specifically designed for:

- Orchestra Members: Musicians of all levels who are part of an orchestra and need a centralised platform to stay connected with their peers.
- Music Enthusiasts: Individuals who are passionate about orchestral music and want to engage in discussions, share content, and collaborate on musical pieces.
- Orchestra Administrators: Individuals responsible for organising and managing orchestra activities, including rehearsals, performances, and events.

### Solution

Harmonia Sinfonia aims to address these issues by providing a dedicated platform where orchestra members can:

- Stay Connected: Promote continuous and streamlined communication among members through posts, comments, and private messaging.
- Share Content: Easily share posts, music pieces, and other relevant content within the community, enhancing collaboration and engagement.
- Engage and Collaborate: Generate discussions, likes, and comments to foster a vibrant community and encourage member interaction.
- Coordinate Activities: Efficiently organise and manage events, rehearsals, and performances, ensuring that all members are informed and involved.

By solving these problems, Harmonia Sinfonia aims to enhance the overall experience for orchestra members, ensuring they remain engaged, informed, and connected. This platform not only facilitates better communication and collaboration but also strengthens the sense of community among members, ultimately contributing to a more cohesive and productive orchestra.

## Wireframes

Creating the wireframes for Harmonia Sinfonia was important in bringing the project to life. These blueprints helped me visualise the platform's structure and flow, ensuring an intuitive user experience.

For me, it was about more than just placing elements on a page. I imagined how you would navigate, create posts, send messages, and engage with other members. By focusing on both desktop and mobile versions, I aimed to make sure the user experience is smooth and enjoyable on any device.

Below are the wireframes for key sections, illustrating my commitment to a user-friendly and responsive design.

## Design Rationale

### Introduction

Harmonia Sinfonia's design prioritises user experience by ensuring the platform is intuitive, accessible, and engaging. Key UX principles applied include:

1. Consistency:

- Navigation: Consistent placement of navigation elements across all pages.
- Styling: Uniform color schemes, typography, and button styles.

2. Feedback:

- User Actions: Immediate feedback for actions like liking a post or submitting a comment.
- Form Validation: Real-time validation informs users of errors or successful submissions instantly.

3. Simplicity:

- Clean Layout: Minimalistic design with ample white space and clear section dividers.
- Direct Interactions: Key actions are easily accessible without unnecessary steps.

### Information Hierarchy

- The platform follows a clear information hierarchy to guide users effortlessly:

1. Homepage:

- Dynamic Feed: Displays recent posts, upcoming events, and featured content prominently.
- Navigation Bar: Provides quick access to main sections like profiles, events, and posts.

2. Profiles:

- User Profile Page: Displays personal information, posts, and interactions in a well-organized manner.

3. Posts and Interactions:

- Post Layout: Clear structure with user information, post content, and interaction buttons.
- Comment Threads: Nested comments to show relationships clearly.

4. Notifications:

- Dropdown and Page: Accessible via a bell icon in the navigation bar, with a dedicated page for a comprehensive list.

### Responsive Design

The platform is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices:

- Flexible Grid System: Uses Bootstrapâ€™s grid system for a fluid layout.
- Mobile Navigation: Collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
- Touch-Friendly Elements: Designed with sufficient spacing for touch interaction.

### Colour Scheme

- `#3B0D11` (Dark Burgundy): Used for the hover state of primary buttons.
- `#FFF1E6` (Cream): Used for the site background, button text, and footer text.
- `#2E4057` (Deep Blue): Used for the site text, footer background, and primary header color.
- `#FFC857` (Golden Yellow): Used for hover state of nav links and primary button background.
- `#8D8D92` (Soft Gray): Used for the site background and form container shadows.

![Colour Scheme](/documentation/colour-scheme.png)

[Coolors](coolors.co) was used to create the color palette.

To simplify updates to the global colour scheme, I used CSS :root variables. This allows for easy changes by updating only one value, rather than searching through the entire CSS file.

### Integration with Bootstrap

The site utilises Bootstrap for its responsive grid system and components. Bootstrap's classes and components were customised using the defined color variables to ensure consistency across the site. For example, the navbar, buttons, and form elements are styled to match the brand colors, enhancing the cohesive look and feel.

### Typography

The simple typography on the site was designed for readability and a clean, professional look.

- **Font Family:** Arial, sans-serif is used for its clarity and wide acceptance.
- **Font Sizes:**
*Base Font Size: 16px for body text.
*Headings: Scaled sizes create a visual hierarchy (e.g., h1 is 2.5em, h2 is 1.5em).
- **Font Weights:**
*Bold: For headings and important text.
*Normal: For regular body text.
- **Text Colors:**
*Primary Text Color: `#2E4057` (Deep Blue) for most text.
*Footer Text Color: `#FFF1E6` (Cream) for footer text, contrasting with the #2E4057 background.
- **Text Alignment:**
*Centered Text: For headers and key sections.
*Left-aligned Text: For body content.## Database Design

## Data Model Design

The structure of the database is illustrated using an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD). This diagram demonstrates how different entities within the Harmonia Sinfonia platform are interrelated, providing an overview of the data flow and the connections between various models.

![Entity Relationship Diagram](/documentation/entity-relationship-diagram.png)

### Models

In this project, I used Django's built in Allauth library to handle user authentication, registration, and account management. Allauth is an authentication solution that supports aspects such as email verification and social authentication. Also, the use of the Cloudinary library was designed to manage and optimise media assets such as images and videos.

### Users (Allauth User Model)

The `Users` model represents the registered users of the platform. Allauth handles the creation and management of this model.

| PK  | id (unique) | Type       | Notes |
| --- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- |
|     | username    | CharField  |       |
|     | email       | EmailField |       |

## User Experience

## User Stories

To ensure Harmonia Sinfonia meets the needs of its users, I have developed a series of user stories that capture the key functionalities and interactions required by different user groups. These user stories help guide the development process, ensuring that the platform remains user-centered and delivers a valuable experience for all members.

The user stories are prioritised using the MoSCoW method, which categorises features into four groups:

- **Must Have:** Essential features that are fundamental to the platform's functionality and must be included in the initial release.
- **Should Have:** Important features that significantly enhance the user experience but are not critical for the platform's basic operation.
- **Could Have:** Desirable features that improve the user experience but can be deferred to a later release if necessary.
- **Won't Have:** Features that are not considered for the current scope but might be included in future updates.

This prioritisation ensures a clear focus on delivering the most critical features first while allowing for iterative improvements based on user feedback and evolving needs.

Below are the categorised user stories for Harmonia Sinfonia:

## Agile Approach

The development process for Harmonia Sinfonia followed Agile methodology, emphasising continuous improvement throughout the development lifecycle.

### Project Management

GitHub Projects served as the primary Agile tool for managing the development tasks. While GitHub Projects isn't a specialised Agile tool, it was used with the right tags, project creation, and issue assignments to fit the needs of the project.

![GitHub Projects](/documentation/project-management.png)
![GitHub Issues)](/documentation/issues.png)

### User Stories Mapping

User stories were crucial in mapping out the development progress. They were categorised into EPICs A, B, C, D, E, and F based on user types and content specificity. The user stories were organised on a Kanban board, providing a visual representation of the backlog and the current status of tasks. The MoSCoW method was used to prioritise these stories, categorising them into Must have, Should have, Could have, and Won't have, ensuring that the most critical features were developed first.

### Kanban Board

The basic Kanban board in GitHub Projects (see above) helped visualise the workflow and track the progress of tasks. Tasks moved across columns from the backlog, through development stages, to testing, and finally to completion. This setup provided clarity on the workload and helped in managing the project efficiently.

### Continuous Improvement

Despite working solo on this project, continuous improvement was a key focus. Regular retrospectives allowed reflection on past work, identification of areas for improvement, and thinking through possible solutions. This practice ensured that the development processes and product quality were consistently enhanced.

For a detailed view of the project management and task progression, refer to the [GitHub Project board](https://github.com/users/NickCMoore/projects/2).

- **CSRF Tokens**: All forms that modify data include CSRF tokens, which protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. This token is automatically added by Django to every form and validated upon form submission, ensuring that requests are legitimate and come from authenticated users.

These security measures aim to ensure that Harmonia Sinfonia protects user data, maintains secure interactions, and adheres to best practices in web security.

## Deployment

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses Heroku, a platform that allows developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

#### Deployment Steps

1. **Create a New App:**
   - Go to your Heroku Dashboard.
   - Click on `New` in the top-right corner and select `Create new app`.
   - Enter a unique app name and choose a region (EU or USA), then click `Create App`.

2. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - Navigate to the `Settings` tab.
   - Click `Reveal Config Vars` and set the following variables:

     ```python
     Key               Value
     CLOUDINARY_URL    your_cloudinary_api_key
     DATABASE_URL      your_elephantsql_database_url
     DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC 1 (remove this for final deployment)
     SECRET_KEY        your_secret_key
     ```

3. **Prepare for Deployment:**
   - Ensure you have the following files in your project:
     - `requirements.txt`
     - `Procfile`

   - To install required packages, run:

     ```bash
     pip3 install -r requirements.txt
     ```

   - To update your `requirements.txt` file with any new packages, run:

     ```bash
     pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
     ```

   - Create a `Procfile` with the following command:

     ```bash
     echo web: gunicorn your_app_name.wsgi > Procfile
     ```

     Replace `your_app_name` with the name of your primary Django app where `settings.py` is located.

4. **Deploy the Application:**
   - **Automatic Deployment:**
     - In Heroku, go to the `Deploy` tab.
     - Connect your GitHub repository and enable Automatic Deployments.

   - **Manual Deployment via Terminal:**
     - Log in to Heroku:

       ```bash
       heroku login -i
       ```

     - Set Heroku remote:

       ```bash
       heroku git:remote -a your_app_name
       ```

       Replace `your_app_name` with your Heroku app name.
     - Push your code to Heroku:

       ```bash
       git push heroku main
       ```

Your project should now be deployed to Heroku!
