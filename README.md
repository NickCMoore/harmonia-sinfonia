# **_Harmonia Sinfonia_**

**Background**

Welcome to [Harmonia Sinfonia](https://harmonia-sinfonia-ec3a4797e71d.herokuapp.com/), a dedicated platform designed to connect orchestra members in a seamless and engaging way. As a musician, I understand the importance of staying connected and informed outside of rehearsals and performances. Harmonia Sinfonia aims to bridge this gap by providing a space where members can share content, communicate privately, and stay updated on all orchestra-related activities.

This project combines my passion for music and technology, aiming to foster a vibrant community where members can collaborate, support each other, and enhance their musical journey. Whether members want to share the latest performance, discuss music pieces, or simply stay in touch with fellow musicians, Harmonia Sinfonia is here to support them.

## Background

## Agile Approach

## Problem Statement

## Wireframes

Creating the wireframes for Harmonia Sinfonia was important in bringing the project to life. These blueprints helped me visualise the platform's structure and flow, ensuring an intuitive user experience.

For me, it was about more than just placing elements on a page. I imagined how you would navigate, create posts, send messages, and engage with other members. By focusing on both desktop and mobile versions, I aimed to make sure the user experience is smooth and enjoyable on any device.

Below are the wireframes for key sections, illustrating my commitment to a user-friendly and responsive design.

# Deployment

## Local Deployment

## Heroku Deployment

This project uses Heroku, a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select New in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select Create new app from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select Create App.
- From the new app Settings, click Reveal Config Vars, and set the value of KEY to PORT, and the value to 8000 then select add.
- Further down, to support dependencies, select Add Buildpack.
- The order of the buildpacks is important, select Python first, then Node.js second. (if they are not in this order, you can drag them to rearrange them)
- Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.
  - requirements.txt
  - Procfile

You can install this project's requirements (where applicable) using: pip3 install -r requirements.txt. If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using: pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt

The Procfile can be created with the following command: echo web: node index.js > Procfile

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your GitHub repository to the newly created app:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: heroku login -i
- Set the remote for Heroku: heroku git:remote -a <app_name> (replace app_name with your app, without the angle-brackets)
- After performing the standard Git add, commit, and push to GitHub, you can now type: git push heroku main

The frontend terminal should now be connected and deployed to Heroku.
