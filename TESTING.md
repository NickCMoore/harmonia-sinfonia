## Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive testing approach and results for Harmonia Sinfonia. The purpose of this testing file is to ensure that all functionalities of the platform operate correctly and efficiently, providing an optimal user experience. The testing covers various aspects, including validation of code, performance, security, usability, and compatibility across different browsers and devices.

### Testing Strategy

The testing approach includes both manual and automated testing procedures. The key components of the strategy are:

- **Validator Testing**: Ensuring that the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python code conform to the respective standards and best practices.
- **Lighthouse Testing**: Utilising Lighthouse to audit the performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices of the web pages.
- **Manual Testing**: Conducting detailed manual tests to validate the functionality and user experience across different scenarios.
- **Automated Testing**: Implementing automated tests to regularly check the integrity of the application's functionalities.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Testing the application on multiple browsers to ensure consistent behaviour and appearance.
- **Responsiveness**: Verifying that the application is fully responsive and works well on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- **Bugs**: Tracking and resolving bugs to improve the stability and reliability of the platform.

This structured approach was designed so that Harmonia Sinfonia meets the highest standards of quality, performance, and user satisfaction.

## Validator Testing

### HTML

I have used the recommended HTML W3C Validator to validate all of my HTML files.

Since my project uses Django templates, such as {% for %}, {% url 'home' %}, and {{ variable|filter }}, it cannot be directly validated. Instead, I followed these steps to validate my HTML:

1. Render the Page in the Browser: Load the Django page in a browser.
2. View Source and Copy HTML: Right-click on the page and select "View Page Source" (or use a similar command) to see the rendered HTML. Copy this HTML content.
3. Validate the Copied HTML: Go to the Nu Html Checker (or any other HTML validator), paste the copied HTML into the "Validate by Input" section, and run the validation.

This ensured the HTML generated by my Django templates was correctly validated.

### CSS

I validated my CSS file using the recommended CSS Jigsaw Validator.

| File       | Result | Issue                        | Screenshot                                      | Notes                        |
|------------|--------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| style.css  | Pass   | None                         | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/css-pass.png) | No issues                    |

### JavaScript

I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to validate all of my JavaScript files.

| File       | Result | Issue                        | Screenshot                                      | Notes                        |
|------------|--------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| index.js   | Pass   | None                         | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/js-pass.png) | No issues                    |

### Python

I have used [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) and built-in VSCode extensions (Flake8 and autopep8) to validate the Python files. The initial linting brought up several errors, which were primarily related to blank spaces and line spacing issues.

| File               | Result | Screenshot                                      | Notes                                      |
|--------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Various (initial)  | Fail   | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/cipythonlinter.png) | Issues with blank spaces and line spacing  |
| Various (improved) | Pass   | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/pythonimprovederrors.png) | Remaining issues related to line length    |

After resolving these initial issues, the remaining problems were mostly related to line length, which are advisory and do not necessarily impact functionality.

## Lighthouse Testing

I used Google Chrome's Lighthouse tool to perform audits on performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices.

This comprehensive defensive programming test plan ensures that the Harmonia Sinfonia project handles edge cases effectively and provides appropriate feedback to the user, enhancing the overall user experience and maintaining application stability.


## Automated Testing

Automated testing is a crucial part of ensuring the stability and reliability of the Harmonia Sinfonia platform. This section outlines the automated tests implemented for various parts of the application, along with the results.

### Automated Test Implementation

I used Django's built-in testing framework to create automated tests for our application. Below are the key components tested:

1. **Profiles App**
2. **Posts App**
3. **Events App**
4. **Home App**
5. **Authentication App**

Each app's testing includes views, models, and forms to ensure all functionalities work as expected.

### Running the Tests

To run the tests, use the following command in the terminal:

```sh
python3 manage.py test
```

## Bugs

### Resolved Bugs

During the development of this project, all encountered bugs were resolved and documented through git commit messages labeled as 'FIX'. Although an alternative approach could have been to raise issues through GitHub, I opted to track bugs within the git commit history to maintain a streamlined project management process:
