## Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive testing approach and results for Harmonia Sinfonia. The purpose of this testing file is to ensure that all functionalities of the platform operate correctly and efficiently, providing an optimal user experience. The testing covers various aspects, including validation of code, performance, security, usability, and compatibility across different browsers and devices.

### Testing Strategy

The testing approach includes both manual and automated testing procedures. The key components of the strategy are:

- **Validator Testing**: Ensuring that the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python code conform to the respective standards and best practices.
- **Lighthouse Testing**: Utilising Lighthouse to audit the performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices of the web pages.
- **Manual Testing**: Conducting detailed manual tests to validate the functionality and user experience across different scenarios.
- **Automated Testing**: Implementing automated tests to regularly check the integrity of the application's functionalities.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Testing the application on multiple browsers to ensure consistent behaviour and appearance.
- **Responsiveness**: Verifying that the application is fully responsive and works well on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- **Bugs**: Tracking and resolving bugs to improve the stability and reliability of the platform.

This structured approach was designed so that Harmonia Sinfonia meets the highest standards of quality, performance, and user satisfaction.

## Validator Testing

### HTML

I have used the recommended HTML W3C Validator to validate all of my HTML files.

Since my project uses Django templates, such as {% for %}, {% url 'home' %}, and {{ variable|filter }}, it cannot be directly validated. Instead, I followed these steps to validate my HTML:

1. Render the Page in the Browser: Load the Django page in a browser.
2. View Source and Copy HTML: Right-click on the page and select "View Page Source" (or use a similar command) to see the rendered HTML. Copy this HTML content.
3. Validate the Copied HTML: Go to the Nu Html Checker (or any other HTML validator), paste the copied HTML into the "Validate by Input" section, and run the validation.

This ensured the HTML generated by my Django templates was correctly validated.

### CSS

I validated my CSS file using the recommended CSS Jigsaw Validator.

| File       | Result | Issue                        | Screenshot                                      | Notes                        |
|------------|--------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| style.css  | Pass   | None                         | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/css-pass.png) | No issues                    |

### JavaScript

I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to validate all of my JavaScript files.

| File       | Result | Issue                        | Screenshot                                      | Notes                        |
|------------|--------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| index.js   | Pass   | None                         | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/js-pass.png) | No issues                    |

### Python

I have used [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) and built-in VSCode extensions (Flake8 and autopep8) to validate the Python files. The initial linting brought up several errors, which were primarily related to blank spaces and line spacing issues.

| File               | Result | Screenshot                                      | Notes                                      |
|--------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Various (initial)  | Fail   | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/cipythonlinter.png) | Issues with blank spaces and line spacing  |
| Various (improved) | Pass   | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/pythonimprovederrors.png) | Remaining issues related to line length    |

After resolving these initial issues, the remaining problems were mostly related to line length, which are advisory and do not necessarily impact functionality.

## Lighthouse Testing

I used Google Chrome's Lighthouse tool to perform audits on performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices.

## Manual Testing

### User Story Testing

The following table provides a detailed overview of the testing performed for each user story to ensure that the platform meets all requirements and provides a seamless user experience. The tests were performed by an independent user (aside from the Admin User Story testing). Feedback comments have been left as received.

### New Visitors (EPIC A)

| User Story | Test Scenario | Expected Outcome | Pass/Fail | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| As a new visitor, I can sign up so that I can join the platform and become a registered member. | Sign up with valid details | User is registered and redirected to home page | P | |
| As a new site user, I would like to clearly see the site's purpose, so that I can decide whether or not to sign up. | Visit homepage and read about the platform | Clear information about the platform's purpose is displayed | P | |

### Registered Users (EPIC B)

| User Story | Test Scenario | Expected Outcome | Pass/Fail | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| As a registered user, I can log in so that I can access my account and interact with the platform. | Log in with valid credentials | User is logged in and redirected to their feed | P | I successfully signed up and created a user account susanb. When first signed up it took me to the feed but subsequent logins opened to same intro pages as a non-logged in user. I noted that very little information is required to sign up. Is it worth at least including the name of the person when signing up? Email to be able to contact / send notifications (e.g. to say a post has been deleted or their account is being deleted) Where did you hear about us? Which instrument do you play? |
| As a registered user, I can view posts so that I can see content shared by other orchestra members. | Navigate to feed | Posts from followed members are displayed | P  | I can visit site and click through to find out more. I subscribed to the newsletter and saw confirmation of this at the top of the page. Contact Us requires a sign up - users would probably prefer to send an email rather than create an account. |
| As a registered user, I can create new posts so that I can share my own content with the orchestra community. | Create a new post with text and image | Post is created and displayed in the feed | P  | Cannot create paragraphs though. I was also able to edit. Images are no longer visible after checking a day later.  |
| As a registered user, I can delete my own posts so that I can remove content I no longer want to share. | Delete a post created by the user | Post is removed from the feed | P  | Green banner with confirmation at the top of the page. |
| As a registered user, I can like posts so that I can express appreciation for content shared by others. | Like a post | Like count increases and like icon changes colour | P  | I am able to like the post but number of likes are not visible on main post page. |
| As a registered user, I can comment on posts so that I can engage in discussions with other members. | Comment on a post | Comment is added and displayed under the post | P |  Green banner with confirmation at the top of the page. |
| As a registered user, I can delete my own comments so that I can remove comments I no longer want to share. | Delete a comment made by the user | Comment is removed from the post | P  | Green banner with confirmation at the top of the page. |
| As a registered user, I can follow/unfollow members so that I can customise my feed and stay updated on specific members. | Follow/unfollow a member | Follow/unfollow action is successful, and feed updates accordingly | F |  I was unable to find where I can follow people |
| As a registered user, I can view the timestamp of posts so that I can see when the posts were made for context. | View a post's timestamp | Timestamp is displayed with the post | P | |
| As a registered user, I can receive notifications so that I can stay updated on interactions with my content. | Like a post/comment, receive a message | Notifications are received and displayed | P | I saw that you'd commented on my horns post but I did not receive a notification for this.  |
| As a registered user, I can search for posts and members so that I can quickly find specific content or users. | Use search function | Relevant posts and members are displayed in search results | P |  I searched for 'horn' and 'outreach' and both searches returned exected results  |
| As a registered user, I can edit my profile so that I can update my personal information and preferences. | Edit profile information | Profile is updated with new information | P |  I created and edited a profile for myself. |
| As a registered user, I can like comments so that I can show appreciation for other members' comments. | Like a comment | Like count increases and like icon changes colour | P | I upvoted a comment. Not sure I like the term upvote when using likes on the page also and they are effectively the same thing. |
| As a registered user, I can expand posts so that I can see the full content of a post without leaving the feed. | Expand a post | Full content of the post is displayed | F | Dev comment - not included in this release (Won't do) |
| As a registered user, I can send private messages so that I can communicate privately with other members. | Send a private message | Message is sent and displayed in the recipient's inbox | F | I was unable to find where I can message people. Dev comment - not included in this release (Won't do) |
| As a registered user, I can report or flag inappropriate content so that it can be reviewed by admins for action. | Report a post/comment | Content is flagged and added to admin review |P  | |

### Admin Users (EPIC C)

| User Story | Test Scenario | Expected Outcome | Pass/Fail | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| As an admin, I can delete posts and comments so that I can remove inappropriate or violating content from the platform. | Delete a flagged post/comment | Post/comment is removed from the platform | P | |
| As an admin, I can review flagged content so that I can manage and moderate reported content effectively. | Review flagged posts/comments | Admin can view and take action on flagged content | P  | |
| As an admin, I can unflag content so that I can dismiss flags for content that does not violate guidelines. | Unflag a post/comment | Content is unflagged and removed from the flagged list | P  | |
| As an admin, I can suspend user accounts so that I can temporarily block members who repeatedly violate guidelines. | Suspend a user account | User account is suspended and unable to log in | P  | |
| As an admin, I can use content moderation tools so that I can manage and filter content effectively on the platform. | Use content moderation tools | Tools function as expected and assist in content management | F | Dev comment - not included in this release (Won't do)|

This comprehensive testing ensures that all user stories are fully implemented and functioning correctly, providing a robust and user-friendly platform for all members of Harmonia Sinfonia.

## Defensive Testing

This comprehensive defensive programming test plan ensures that the Harmonia Sinfonia project handles edge cases effectively and provides appropriate feedback to the user, enhancing the overall user experience and maintaining application stability.

## Automated Testing

Automated testing is a crucial part of ensuring the stability and reliability of the Harmonia Sinfonia platform. This section outlines the automated tests implemented for various parts of the application, along with the results.

### Automated Test Implementation

I used Django's built-in testing framework to create automated tests for our application. Below are the key components tested:

1. **Profiles App**
2. **Posts App**
3. **Events App**
4. **Home App**
5. **Authentication App**

Each app's testing includes views, models, and forms to ensure all functionalities work as expected.

### Running the Tests

To run the tests, use the following command in the terminal:

```sh
python3 manage.py test
```

## Bugs

### Resolved Bugs

During the development of this project, all encountered bugs were resolved and documented through git commit messages labeled as 'FIX'. Although an alternative approach could have been to raise issues through GitHub, I opted to track bugs within the git commit history to maintain a streamlined project management process:

### Unresolved Bugs

- Notification Bell Icon Colour: The bell icon in the notifications dropdown does not always change colour to indicate whether there are unread notifications or not. This functionality was planned but not fully implemented. Future updates will address this.
